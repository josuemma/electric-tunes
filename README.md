# Electric Tunes

A simple Electron app, demonstrating several principles including node usage in the render process, ipc communication, native os bindings (tray icon), and distribution (packaging).

The folder the app pulls music files from is hardcoded. You can change this folder by updating the 'musicFolder' variable at the top of the app.js file.
